          <p class="policy__paragraph--small">A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.</p>
          <p class="policy__paragraph--small">Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.</p>
          <p class="policy__paragraph--small">Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.</p>
          <p class="policy__paragraph--small">Cookies can be used by web servers to identify and track users as they navigate different pages on a website and identify users returning to a website.</p>
